### 'ASCII' - Computer-friendly representations
'A':65, 'B':66, 'C':67... 'Z':90 (+26-1)

### 'RGB' - Color compositions, how advanced bits are in terms of expression
Intensity of each color, stored as hex, each value R, G and B capping out at 255<sub>10</sub>.

### 'A Good Algorithm' - Binary search example
Typically, there's functions or procedures, logical branching, conditioning and looping (and temporary data but not mentioned here)

### 'CS50 Staff' - Alumnus, BTS & on-demand assistants
Numbering over 100, with Rob claiming 2017's CS50 to have the most number of changes.

### 'CS50 Events' - Harvard brings more to the table
- CS50 Puzzle Day: (in groups 2-4)
- Weekly friday group lunches to 'make a large class feel more intimate' and 'bring together alumnus and friends from industry'
- CS50 50 Coding Contest: After 6/7 weeks of class, pit their wits! (in groups 2-4)
- CS50 Hackathon: 7:00p.m.-7:00a.m. to spend 12hrs on the final project (in collab with mentors)

### 'Introducing Scratch' - MIT's Language designed to introduce children to programming
It serves as a starting platform to allow children to learn how to express their **ideas** with computational thinking. 
A graphical interface (similar to Blender)
Typical Components (Elaborated):
1. Functions
2. Loops
2. Variables
3. Boolean Expressions
4. Arrays
5. Threads - Multi-threading, or simultaneous processing, leverages upon the multi-core processing units of modern computers
6. Events 

### 'Oscartime' - Game made by the instructors to demonstrate game logic
Game components:
- Sprites - graphics that render as an overlay *(physical appearance)* of an arbitrary, coded game object
- Events - Listen for them to trigger responses to user interactions 
- Step-by-step development: debugging needs to be able to occur for individual components (thus functions & procedures would be highly preferred [and possibly *OOP*])

### 'Threads' - Simultaneous Objects' Behaviours
- Infinite looping - the game needs to run processes all the time (but may be limited as in Unity smart processing reductions) for listening and graphics updates etc.

### 'Cough-3' - Methods, Procedures, Functions
Functions may use other functions to carry out the modularisation of the entire code (for ease of debugging & to differentiate processes and finally end up with easy to manage code)
